Your challenge is standing firm without hardening." },
  3: { title:"The Communicator", archetype:"Artist / Expresser", desc:"You're here to develop creative self-expression, joy, and social magnetism.

Depth amplifies your natural brilliance." },

The strongest bridges sway in the wind." },
  5: { title:"The Adventurer", archetype:"Freedom-Seeker / Catalyst", desc:"You're here to learn through experience, change, and variety. You absorb knowledge by doing, not studying.

Trust your intuition alongside your analysis." },

You have natural executive ability and an instinct for large-scale achievement.", shadow:"Worshipping status, ruthlessness, financial obsession", growth:"Use power for others, not just yourself. Your lesson: authority exercised ethically becomes lasting influence." },
  9: { title:"The Humanitarian", archetype:"Sage / Philanthropist", desc:"You're here to develop compassion, wisdom, and universal love.

Your letting-go becomes others' breathing room." },

The pyramid was built one block at a time. Your blueprints manifest through patience." },
