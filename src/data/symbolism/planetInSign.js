      reading: "No classical dignity attaches; Neptune was located in 1846, long after the tables were fixed. Modern practice reads dissolution meeting the point of ignition.",
      principle: "Fourteen years of births share this placement, which makes it the widest of the commonly cited natal markers. Everything particular about it comes from house, aspect, and the condition of the sign's traditional ruler.",

      plain: "Neptune stands in fixed earth, in a sign of Venus.",

      principle: "Neptune was found by calculation before it was found by observation, its position predicted from irregularities in the motion of Uranus and confirmed at the telescope in 1846. Its symbolism in modern practice was assembled after the fact, from the name and from the period.",

      plain: "Neptune stands in mutable air, in a sign of Mercury.",
      reading: "Modern readings put dissolution in the sign of report and exchange and treat it as a generational condition of information. No classical attribution exists.",
      principle: "Mercury's fall in Pisces and the modern association of Neptune with that sign are sometimes joined into a single argument about the dissolving of the analytic faculty. The classical half of that argument is documented; the modern half is inference laid over it.",

      plain: "Neptune stands in cardinal water, the Moon's own sign.",
      reading: "Water in water is read by modern practice as the most consonant ground for this body, and some modern sources propose Cancer as its exaltation. Others propose Leo, and neither proposal is classical.",
      principle: "The Moon rules the sign in every scheme, so the traditional route into this placement runs through lunar condition. Modern readings that bypass the ruler discard the only part of the technique that is well attested.",

      reading: "Modern practice reads dissolution at the fixed centre, and some modern tables propose Leo as Neptune's exaltation. The proposal is recent and contested.",
      principle: "An exaltation asserted for a body the classical tables never knew is a modern extension of an ancient structure, and extensions of that kind multiply without any mechanism for settling them. The seven classical exaltations are stable across centuries of transmission; the proposed ones are not.",

      plain: "Neptune stands in mutable earth, Mercury's night sign and exaltation.",

      reading: "Modern practice reads a generational softening in the terms of agreement. No traditional attribution exists.",

      plain: "Neptune stands in fixed water, Mars's night sign in traditional practice.",
      reading: "Modern readings pair dissolution with concentration and treat the combination as generationally significant. Nothing classical applies.",
      principle: "Modern practice claims Scorpio for Pluto and Pisces for Neptune, so a Neptune placement in Scorpio is a meeting of two modern rulerships and no traditional one. Where a reading rests entirely on modern assignments, that foundation should be stated rather than assumed.",

    Sagittarius: {
      plain: "Neptune stands in mutable fire, the day sign of Jupiter.",
      reading: "Modern practice reads a generational dissolving of the frames that give meaning. No classical attribution exists.",
      principle: "Jupiter rules Sagittarius in every scheme and Pisces in the traditional one, so Neptune here stands in a sign whose ruler modern practice has partly displaced elsewhere. Tracing the rulership carefully keeps the two systems distinguishable.",

    Capricorn: {
      plain: "Neptune stands in cardinal earth, in a sign of Saturn.",
      reading: "Modern practice reads dissolution meeting structure as a generational theme. Nothing in the older material addresses it.",
      principle: "Saturn rules the sign and Mars is exalted in it, which makes Capricorn the most heavily marked of the twelve for hard testimony in the classical tables. A body holding no essential dignity anywhere adds nothing to that reckoning.",

      reading: "Under the modern scheme this is Neptune in its own sign. Under the traditional scheme it is an unranked body in Jupiter's house, alongside Venus's exaltation and Mercury's doubled debility.",
      principle: "The modern assignment displaces one of Jupiter's two domiciles, while the classical dignities of the sign remain in the tables regardless. Both layers are present in most contemporary practice without being reconciled.",

      reading: "No classical dignity attaches; Pluto was located in 1930. Some modern sources propose Aries as its exaltation and others propose Leo, and the proposals contradict each other.",
      principle: "Uneven sign durations mean a Pluto sign describes cohorts of very different sizes, which weakens any comparison between one Pluto generation and another. The orbital fact does work that interpretation usually claims for itself.",

    Taurus: {
      plain: "Pluto stands in fixed earth, in a sign of Venus.",

      principle: "Pluto is furthest from the Sun in the Taurus and Gemini stretch of the zodiac and moves slowest there, holding those signs for the longest spans. Sign placement is therefore a weaker individuating marker in this part of the circle than in the opposite one.",

    Gemini: {
      plain: "Pluto stands in mutable air, in a sign of Mercury.",
      reading: "Modern readings place transformation in the sign of exchange, as a slow generational condition. No classical attribution exists.",
      principle: "Near aphelion Pluto moves slowly enough that a single sign can span a full human generation, which makes cohort claims about it very hard to test. Precision about the orbit acts as a check on interpretive drift.",

      plain: "Pluto stands in cardinal water, the Moon's own sign.",
      reading: "Modern practice reads generational transformation of the household and of what is inherited. Nothing classical applies.",

    Leo: {
      plain: "Pluto stands in fixed fire, the Sun's own sign.",
      reading: "Some modern sources propose Leo as Pluto's exaltation, and modern practice reads transformation at the fixed solar centre. The classical tables record only the Sun's domicile here.",
      principle: "Leo carries one classical dignity and no exaltation, so a proposed modern exaltation would fill a genuine gap in the table, which is part of why such proposals are attractive and part of why they warrant care. Filling a gap is not the same as finding an entry.",

      reading: "Modern practice reads generational transformation in the terms of relation. Nothing traditional applies.",

      reading: "Under the modern scheme this is Pluto in its own sign. Under the traditional scheme it is an unranked body in Mars's house, where the Moon is also in fall.",
      principle: "Pluto reaches perihelion in this part of its orbit and crosses Scorpio faster than any other sign, in roughly twelve years, making this the shortest Pluto cohort there is. The modern rulership and the orbital speed are unrelated facts that happen to meet in one sign.",

      reading: "Modern practice reads transformation of what is believed and sought. No classical attribution exists.",

      reading: "Modern practice reads transformation working on structure and office as a generational theme. Nothing in the classical material addresses it.",
