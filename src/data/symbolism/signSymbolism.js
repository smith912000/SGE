Ptolemaic sources give the sign to Jupiter as the nocturnal domicile, place Venus exalted here, and set Mercury in both fall and detriment. Melothesia assigned the feet, closing the head-to-foot sequence that opened at Aries.",
    principle:
      "This is the third of the contested rulerships, and it follows the same pattern as Scorpio and Aquarius: Jupiter by the older geometry, Neptune by later thematic assignment. Pisces is the only sign in the Ptolemaic table where a single planet carries fall and detriment together, and that planet is Mercury, which traditional practitioners read as a statement about measure meeting what will not be measured. The sign also carries the weight of the precession question, since it is the slow passage of the vernal point through the constellation of the Fishes that gives the phrase about a Piscean age whatever astronomical basis it has -- a fact about the constellation, not about the tropical sign of the same name.",
