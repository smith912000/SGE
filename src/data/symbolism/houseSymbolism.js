 *
 * Symbolism records for the twelve houses of the astrological chart, keyed 1..12.
 *
 * Each house is named as a ground or field — a region of subject matter — and never
 * as a prediction about a person. Records carry three depths (plain, reading,
 * principle) plus optional structural fields: energies, tensions, attributions with
 * their lineage, correspondences, contested points, and prompts for the practitioner.
 *
 * At principle depth the Hellenistic doctrine of places (topoi) is held apart from the
 * modern psychological reading. The two lineages share subject matter and diverge in
 * register; where they diverge the record says so rather than resolving it.

 * Voice rule: docs/VOICE.md. Enforced by scripts/smoke-test.mjs.
