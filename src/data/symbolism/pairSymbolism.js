 * What the PAIRING of two classical significators has been taken to mean, as a
 * relation between two principles. Twenty-one records: every pair drawn from
 * the seven classical planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
 * Saturn).
 *
 * These are not compatibility verdicts and not statements about a person. Each
 * record names the two significators, what the tradition attributed to their
 * meeting, the lineage of that attribution, and where the sources disagree.
 *
 * Key convention: the two body names sorted alphabetically and joined with "|".
 * Anything outside the classical seven returns null.
 *
 * Depth: plain (0) -> reading (1) -> principle (2). Structural fields
 * (energies, tensions, attributions, correspondences, contested, prompts) are
 * revealed as depth increases.
