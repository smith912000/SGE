  Aries:       "Saturn in Aries tests your courage and independence. Life asks you to develop genuine self-reliance — not the impulsive kind, but the kind that is patient enough to earn its own authority. Your rigidity risk: becoming so self-sufficient that you refuse all help, or so cautious that you lose your natural boldness. Maturity here means learning that real strength asks for help when it's needed.",
  Taurus:      "Saturn in Taurus tests your relationship with security and material worth. Life asks you to build real, lasting value — but slowly and honestly. Your rigidity risk: clinging to money, possessions, or routines so tightly that you can't adapt when life demands change. Maturity here means knowing that true security is internal, not material.",
  Gemini:      "Saturn in Gemini tests your thinking and communication. Life asks you to develop intellectual discipline — to think carefully, speak precisely, and commit to ideas rather than skimming the surface. Your rigidity risk: becoming so guarded in what you say that you lose your natural curiosity and playfulness. Maturity here means thinking that is both serious and alive.",
  Cancer:      "Saturn in Cancer tests your emotional life and family bonds. Life asks you to develop emotional maturity — to feel deeply while remaining functional, and to nurture without losing yourself. Your rigidity risk: building emotional walls so high that no one can reach you, or carrying family obligations until they crush your own life. Maturity here means boundaries that protect without isolating.",
  Leo:         "Saturn in Leo tests your self-expression and need for recognition. Life asks you to earn your spotlight through genuine contribution rather than demanding it through performance. Your rigidity risk: suppressing your creativity and warmth because you fear they're not good enough, or refusing to create unless guaranteed an audience. Maturity here means creating for the work itself, not the applause.",
  Virgo:       "Saturn in Virgo tests your perfectionism and service. Life asks you to develop practical mastery — to be genuinely helpful without destroying yourself with self-criticism. Your rigidity risk: setting impossible standards, then punishing yourself and others for failing to meet them. Maturity here means excellence that includes self-compassion.",
  Libra:       "Saturn in Libra tests your relationships and sense of fairness. Life asks you to learn what genuine partnership requires — commitment, honesty, and the willingness to have difficult conversations. Your rigidity risk: staying in unjust situations because leaving feels unbalanced, or becoming so focused on fairness that you lose spontaneity. Maturity here means relationships built on truth rather than performance.",
  Scorpio:     "Saturn in Scorpio tests your relationship with power, trust, and transformation. Life asks you to face your deepest fears — of loss, betrayal, and vulnerability — and develop genuine strength rather than defensive control. Your rigidity risk: trusting no one, controlling everything, or numbing yourself to avoid the pain of feeling. Maturity here means power that doesn't need to dominate.",
  Sagittarius: "Saturn in Sagittarius tests your beliefs and your relationship with truth. Life asks you to develop genuine wisdom — not just opinions, but knowledge tested by experience. Your rigidity risk: becoming so committed to one worldview that you can't learn from those who see differently, or so cautious about belief that you lose faith entirely. Maturity here means conviction that remains curious.",
  Capricorn:   "Saturn in Capricorn — its home sign — tests your ambition and integrity. Life asks you to build something real and lasting, but through honest means. The pressure to achieve is immense. Your rigidity risk: becoming your job title, measuring all worth by output, and sacrificing health and relationships on the altar of success. Maturity here means achievement that serves life rather than consuming it.",
  Aquarius:    "Saturn in Aquarius tests your individuality and your relationship with community. Life asks you to develop genuine originality — not rebellion for its own sake, but thinking that actually contributes something new. Your rigidity risk: becoming a contrarian who rejects everything, or conforming so completely that your unique perspective is lost. Maturity here means being yourself in service to something larger.",
  Pisces:      "Saturn in Pisces tests your boundaries and your relationship with the invisible. Life asks you to develop spiritual discipline — to be compassionate without being consumed, and to trust intuition while staying grounded. Your rigidity risk: either building walls against your own sensitivity or dissolving into chaos because structure feels like a prison. Maturity here means faith that includes form.",
