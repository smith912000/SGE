  Aries:       { shadow:"Your anger is a lightning bolt — fast, direct, and sometimes destructive. When unconscious, you pick fights to feel powerful, act before thinking, and leave collateral damage you never look back at. You may confuse aggression with strength.", growth:"You're growing when your fire is aimed rather than sprayed — when you fight for things that matter and walk away from things that don't." },
  Taurus:      { shadow:"Your anger is a volcano — slow to build but devastating when it erupts. When unconscious, you suppress rage for months then explode disproportionately. You may use passive resistance as a weapon, or let stubbornness destroy things you actually care about.", growth:"You're growing when you can express frustration as it arises rather than storing it — when your patience is chosen, not repressed." },
  Gemini:      { shadow:"Your anger comes through words — cutting remarks, sarcasm, gossip, or simply talking someone in circles until they give up. When unconscious, you weaponise your intellect, argue for sport, or scatter your energy across so many battles that none of them are won.", growth:"You're growing when your words build rather than cut — when you can disagree without dismantling the other person." },
  Cancer:      { shadow:"Your anger is passive-aggressive and guilt-driven. When unconscious, you withdraw, punish with silence, or use emotional vulnerability as a shield that no one dares challenge. You may redirect anger into worry, caretaking, or self-pity.", growth:"You're growing when you can say 'I'm angry' directly — when you let people deal with the real you rather than a wounded performance." },
  Leo:         { shadow:"Your anger is dramatic and ego-driven.

  Libra:       { shadow:"Your anger is suppressed and indirect.

You may use emotional intimacy as leverage.", growth:"You're growing when you can feel betrayed without retaliating — when your power transforms situations rather than annihilating them." },
  Sagittarius: { shadow:"Your anger is righteous and careless. When unconscious, you deliver brutal honesty without compassion, burn bridges flippantly, or use moral superiority as a weapon.

  Taurus:      { shadow:"Your mind's trap is rigidity — once you've formed an opinion, nothing moves it.

Information overload paralyses your decisions.", growth:"You're growing when your breadth develops depth — when you stay with one idea long enough to truly master it." },
  Cancer:      { shadow:"Your mind's trap is emotional reasoning — you confuse what you feel with what is true.

Your perfectionism in thinking becomes procrastination in living.", growth:"You're growing when 'good enough' becomes a tool — when your precision serves action rather than delaying it." },

  Pisces:      { shadow:"Your mind's trap is confusion — your thoughts merge with feelings, fantasies, and other people's ideas until you can't tell what you actually think. You may avoid rigorous thinking because it feels reductive, or let intuition override evidence when evidence matters.", growth:"You're growing when your imagination is grounded — when your intuitive leaps land on solid reasoning." },
